# har2file

So we can get our network requests called [HAR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.har). After dumping and analysis, I have a idea that HAR can generate files, then write this program.

However, there're many issues and I can't deal, plus I got my needs by other way, so I abandon this project.

Maybe I will write this if I have mood.
